# Open-Pit-Mining-Operations-and-Logistic-Model
The Open-pit Mining house is not able to track all the operational activities at one go due to the vast expanse of the mine. Hence, Production is getting affected and they are not able to meet customers' demands even though there has been no surge in demand.

<b>Solution1:</b> In order to have a smooth and robust computational system, streamlined the mine operations on DBMS and then used concepts such as query folding and stored procedures to build a live monitoring system for mine operators, enabling them to track production activities.
Solution 2: Built overall metrics such as overall equipment efficiency, identified machines with a high risk of down times, evaluated reasons for Down Time, and recommended possible solutions.
Solution 3: Built a Trucks logistic model to provide real-time information about the number of trucks traveling toward the loading area and the number of trucks heading towards the crusher sites and also indicate which truck's current location
